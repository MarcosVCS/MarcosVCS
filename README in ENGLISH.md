## Welcome to my repository!
My name is Marcos Valente, I currently live in Brazil, and I am studying to become a **Data Engineer**.

I recently completed the Data Engineering Bootcamp at SoulCode Academy, where I learned about:

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) | Python | Pandas | Spark | SQL | NoSQL | MongoDB | Data Lake | Data Warehouse | ETL | Big Query

### My projects:
In addition to studying to become a Junior Data Engineer, I am developing an application that provides personalized muscle training for the user based on their goals and the equipment available at registered gyms. With this project, I want to improve my skills in Python, database management (the most important part of the application), MySQL and Google Cloud. 
* Most of my work is in Portuguese, but I plan to translate them to English in the future.

Advanced courses in PySpark, Google Cloud, AWS, and others
